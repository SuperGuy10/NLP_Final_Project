Unsheathe the sword, call the death squad
Let loose the dogs, make me your God
Blaspheme the name, stretch forth thy rod
Get on your knees, make me your God

Unleash the nuns, curse the Earth
Devour the worm, I am your God
Suffer the plague, repent your sin
Declare unclean, my God machine
Number the beasts, sound the horn
Suffer the wrath, bring me your first born
