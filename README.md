# NLP_Final_Project
Music emotion prediction based on lyrics and probability
## Introduction
This project is for UTD 2017 Spring Natural Language Processing course final project under professor Dr. Moldovan.

The goal is to distinguish happy and sad two emotions of entire lyric based on the initial experiments on a preliminary data set of 200 lyrics with different artists and genres which already being classified as happy or sad emotion.

This is my first Python project and also my first project published on GitHub.

## Using Features

* Supervised Learning idea 
* Naive Bayesian Classifier idea 
* Part-of-speech tagging
* Probability and statistics
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)

Since I haven't learned Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligencelearn courses yet, I can only imitate some methods of ideas of Supervised Learning or Naive Bayesian Classifier.
