every night i hope and pray
a dreamlover will come my way
someone to hold in my arms
feel the magic of their charms

cause i want someone to call my own
i want a dreamlover so i don't have to dream alone

dreamlover where are you
with a love, a love so true
and a hand i can hold
be with you as i grow old

(chorus)

someday i don't know how
i hope you'll hear my plea
someway i don't know how
you'll give your love to me

dreamlover, until then
i'll go to sleep and dream again
that's the only thing to do
till all my dreams come true

(chorus)

I want a...dreamlover...so i don't have to dream...alone
